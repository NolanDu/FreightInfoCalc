# FreightInfoCalc
This calculator finds the most cost efficient shipment combination of different containers and LCL. 
If your total CBMs are over 120, the calculator is inaccurate and you should find your values manually.
The values in this calculator are based on shipping costs from June 2022 as follows:
  20' $13800
  40GP $16875
  40HQ $17125
  LCL $675/CBM
If you need to update any of these values, figure out how to edit code and use Github, and then CTRL+F whichever value you are updating and replace all instances.
